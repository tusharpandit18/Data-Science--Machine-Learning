- The data contains 7,195 instances and 21 features. 

- Implementation of Kmeans algorithm in either MATLAB with the number of clusters k ranging
from 2 to 10. 

- To initialize the cluster centers, I have randomly picked them among all the instances.

- Then for each number of clusters, upon convergence of Kmeans, computed the objective function

- Then plotted the objective function value vs. the number of clusters k.
