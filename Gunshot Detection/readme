AXON MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

Objective:
The objective of the project was to distinguish between sound created by a gunshot and a car backfire.

Libraries used:
Librosa - For audio feature extraction 
Scikit-learn - For implementing various machine learning models

Machine Learning Models implemented:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (k =5, default)
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

The submission consists of a zip file containing:
- All the ipython notebook files
- Also, all the output files named GNB_predictions.csv, KNN_predictions.csv, NeuralNets_predictions.csv, SVM_predictions.csv
- Each CSV consists of the test audio_file names and the appropriate predictions

To run the files:
- Extract the files from the zip submitted.
- The zip consists of files named GunDetection_GNB.ipynb, GunDetection_KNN.ipynb, GunDetection_NeuralNets.ipynb, GunDetection_SVM.ipynb
- Before executing files, make sure the they are placed at proper location. All these files are to be placed outside of the discharge-detection folder.

Performances:
GNB: 93.85%
KNN: 94.83%
Neural Networks: 95.26%
SVM with RBF kernel: 94.68%

Conclusion: Neural Networks have the highest accuracy of 95.26%
