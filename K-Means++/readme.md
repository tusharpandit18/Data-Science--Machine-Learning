- The data contains 7,195 instances and 21 features. 

- Implementation of the Kmeans++ algorithm where we want the initialized cluster centers to be
far from each other. 

- The number of clusters range from 2 to 10, 

- Then computed the objective function values versus different number of clusters and ploted the figure.
