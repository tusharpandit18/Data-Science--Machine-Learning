- Read the housing dataset into a pandas dataframe object (dataset available on 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.data')

- Performed exploratory data analysis by plotting scatter plot and heatmap

- Separated the independent and dependant variables

- Divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% separate test data

- Performed Linear regeression on the training data

- Fitted the training data into the model

- Compute the accuracy of the model on test data

- Computed R2-score, RMSE to measure the performance of the model

- Performed Random Forest Regression and measured the performance
