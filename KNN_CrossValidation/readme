- There are 5,000 instances and 1,598 instances in the training set and test set, and each instance has 166 features. 

- Implemented 5-fold cross validation to choose the parameter k for kNN classifier, where k ranges from 1 to 17 (odd k's only)

- Implemented 5-fold cross validation for kNN and plot the average accuracy on the
validation set vs. each possible k. 

- Then chose the best parameter based on these accuracies
and used it to predict on the test data. 

- Reported the parameter k that was chosen, as well as the corresponding accuracy on the test data.

 (20 points) Let us now use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data from 166 to 50.
Then on this new reduced dataset, implement 5-fold cross validation for kNN and plot the
average accuracy on the validation set vs. each possible k 2 K. Choose the best parameter
based on these accuracies and use it to predict on the test data. Report the parameter k you
choose, as well as the corresponding accuracy on the test data.
